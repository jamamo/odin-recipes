    <h1>Somali Pancake recipe</h1>

      <p>
        if you haven't ever made Somali food, one sweet and easy way to start is with malawah. 
        They're gently spiced with some cardamom and ginger and delicious for breakfast 
        or as a snackâ€”especially with honey.
         When it comes to cooking malawah (aka Somali sweet pancake), there are a couple of methods. 
         In one method, the batter is poured and distributed within the pan by tilting the pan in a circular motion, 
         as you would do when making ordinary pancakes or even crepes. The malawah cooks quickly over medium heat for about two minutes.
          The pancake will not require flipping to the other side but will have one golden brown side, while the other remains white and spongy.
          In the second method, the batter is poured in and then flipped over to brown on the other side. 
        Some people will pour the batter in a circular spiral which will be visibly evident when cooked.
         Others pour all the batter into the center of the pan and create the spiral by using a spoon. 
         This recipe opts for cooking the malawah on both sides.
