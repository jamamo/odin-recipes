    <h2>Steps in making the perfect somali pasta</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cilantro and garlic in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.</li>
        <li>Toast cumin seeds in a small pot over low heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Allow to cool, 5 minutes. Grind into a powder.</li>
        <li>Transfer ground cumin to a small bowl. Add Himalayan pink salt, turmeric, paprika, Italian seasoning, seasoning blend, and black pepper to make seasoning mix.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 of the seasoning mix. Add onion; cook and stir until softened,
             about 5 minutes. Add potato and carrots. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>tir tomatoes into the pot and bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in cilantro-garlic mixture and remaining 1/2 of the seasoning mix. Simmer,
            stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 30 to 40 minutes. Thin sauce with water if it seems too thick.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Drain. Serve sauce over pasta.</li>

    </ol>
