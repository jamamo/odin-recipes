    <h1>How to make Somali rice</h1>

    <img src="somali rice" alt="somali rice">

      <p> The somali rice, also knows us Bariis is a traditional rice dish from Somali cuisine.[1][2] 
        The name Isku-dheh karis literally means "cooked mixed together",
         therefore it is sometimes used to more broadly refer to other grain-derived crops that require similar cooking. 
         Hence the more specific term for this dish is bariis isku-dheh karis which means "rice (bariis) cooked mixed together"</p>

    <h2> Steps in making the somali rice</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C)</li>
        <li>Make the xawaash: In a medium bowl</li>
        <li>combine the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and nutmeg. Set aside</li>
        <li>Heat a medium oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil, onion, tomato, garlic, and cinnamon stick</li>
        <li> Season with salt, then add the vegetable stock cube and cilantro. Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the stock cube.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, then stir in the xawaash and soaked rice. Cook for about 3 minutes so rice grains lightly toast.</li>
        <li>Pour in the hot water and increase the heat to high to bring to a boil. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Check periodically to be sure the rice has enough water.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked rice from the oven and drizzle the red and orange f ood colorings on top. Gently mix so there are different colored grains.
            Sprinkle the raisins over the hot rice, cover, and set aside.</li>
        <li> To prepare the topping, mix the potatoes with the orange food coloring in a medium bowl (wear gloves to avoid stained fingers!)</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch ( 2 cm) of oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, 
            then transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
            <li>In the same oil, fry the onion slices until browned and crispy, 2-3 minutes. Add the red peppers cooking for an additional minute.
                Drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li> To assemble the rice, transfer the pilaf to a large serving platter. Top with the fried potatoes, crispy onions, and red bell peppers
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
